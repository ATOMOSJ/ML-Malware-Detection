# ML-Malware-Detection
Title: Malware Detection with Machine Learning (MALWARE DETECTION)

Description:
This repository contains Python code for detecting malware using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for training and testing the models is stored in 'data.csv'.

File Structure:
- data.csv: Contains the dataset with information about malware samples.
- malware_detection.py: Python script for training and evaluating machine learning models for malware detection.
- readme.txt: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.12.1
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- tabulate

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Run the 'malware_detection.py' script. It will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train different classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost), and evaluate their performance using confusion matrices and F1-scores.

Usage:
python malware_detection.py

Results:
The script will display the performance metrics of each classifier in tabular format, including True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and F1-score.

Note:
- Ensure that 'database.csv' is in the same directory as the Python script.
- You may need to adjust the parameters of the classifiers based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of the dataset.
